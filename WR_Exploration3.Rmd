## Data Prep

```{r data load}
setwd("/Users/orly/Desktop/Swim Stats/WR Progression")
wr = read.csv("WRProgression.csv")
head(wr)
```

```{r data setup}
# new columns to split up the distance and the stroke
wr = wr %>%
  separate("Event", 
           sep = " ", 
           into = c("Distance", "Stroke"), 
           remove = FALSE)

```

```{r libraries}


```


## Ideas

Katie, Summer, Ariarne - the 400 Freestyle Preview
- for any stroke/event - total WRs
- for any WRs - timeline of WRs (and what meet was it at)
- for any stroke/event - average re-breaking (ie, breaking their own record)
- for 400 fr - who has broken it the most
- for 400 fr - how much did they break it by
